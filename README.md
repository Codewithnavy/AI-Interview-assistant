Project Overview
This React application serves as an AI-powered interview assistant with dual interfaces for interviewees and interviewers. The system provides a complete interview experience including resume parsing, dynamic question generation, real-time scoring, and comprehensive candidate management.

Architecture
Core System Design
The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

State Management Architecture
The application uses Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for efficient state management:

Candidate Slice: Manages candidate data, profiles, and scores

Interview Slice: Handles active interview sessions, questions, and timing

UI Slice: Controls application state, modals, and navigation

Persistence Layer: Implements automatic state restoration using redux-persist

Data Flow
Resume Processing Pipeline:
Resume Upload → PDF/DOCX Parsing → Field Extraction → Validation → Profile Creation

Interview Execution Flow:
Profile Validation → Question Generation → Timer Management → Answer Collection → Scoring → Summary Generation

Real-time Synchronization:
Both tabs maintain synchronized state through Redux, ensuring consistent data across all interfaces.

Technical Implementation
Resume Processing System
The resume parser utilizes multiple extraction strategies:

typescript
interface ResumeData {
  name?: string;
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
  skills?: string[];
  experience?: string[];
}

class ResumeParser {
  async extractFromPDF(file: File): Promise<ResumeData>
  async extractFromDOCX(file: File): Promise<ResumeData>
  validateExtractedData(data: ResumeData): ValidationResult
}
AI Question Generation Engine
The system implements a structured question generation approach:

typescript
interface Question {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  category: string;
  timeLimit: number;
  expectedAnswer?: string;
}

class QuestionGenerator {
  generateQuestionSet(): Question[]
  getDifficultyProgression(): DifficultyLevel[]
  getTimeLimits(): Record<DifficultyLevel, number>
}
Scoring and Assessment
The AI scoring engine evaluates responses across multiple dimensions:

Technical accuracy and completeness

Code quality and best practices

Problem-solving approach

Communication clarity

Timer Management System
Implements precise countdown timers with automatic progression:

typescript
interface TimerState {
  currentTime: number;
  isActive: boolean;
  isPaused: boolean;
  onTimeUp: () => void;
}

class InterviewTimer {
  start(duration: number): void
  pause(): void
  resume(): void
  reset(): void
}
Core Features
Interviewee Interface
Resume Upload: Drag-and-drop interface supporting PDF and DOCX formats

Smart Field Collection: Automatic extraction with chatbot-driven gap filling

Interactive Chat: Real-time conversation flow with AI interviewer

Progress Tracking: Visual indicators showing interview completion status

Timer Display: Prominent countdown with color-coded urgency levels

Interviewer Dashboard
Candidate Management: Comprehensive list with scoring and status indicators

Detailed Analytics: Individual candidate performance breakdowns

Search and Filter: Advanced filtering by score, completion status, and date

Interview History: Complete chat logs and response analysis

Bulk Operations: Export capabilities for candidate data

Data Persistence Strategy
The application implements multi-layered persistence:

Redux Persist: Automatic state hydration and dehydration

IndexedDB Integration: Large file storage for resumes and chat history

Session Recovery: Intelligent detection and restoration of incomplete sessions

Offline Support: Graceful handling of network disruptions

Error Handling Framework
Comprehensive error management across all system components:

File Upload Errors: Invalid formats, size limitations, parsing failures

Network Errors: API timeouts, connection issues, retry mechanisms

Validation Errors: Missing fields, invalid data formats

Session Errors: State corruption, timer failures, unexpected interruptions

Quality Assurance
Performance Optimization
Code Splitting: Dynamic imports for optimal bundle sizes

Lazy Loading: Component-level lazy loading for improved initial load

Memoization: Strategic use of React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations

Virtual Scrolling: Efficient rendering of large candidate lists

Accessibility Compliance
WCAG 2.1 Standards: Full compliance with accessibility guidelines

Keyboard Navigation: Complete keyboard-only operation support

Screen Reader Support: Semantic HTML and ARIA labels

Color Contrast: High contrast ratios for visual accessibility

Security Considerations
File Validation: Strict file type and size validation

XSS Protection: Input sanitization and output encoding

Data Privacy: Local storage encryption for sensitive information

Session Security: Secure session management and timeout handling
